-- Another Misc Problem: Using OR OPERATOR
EXPLAIN SELECT customer_id FROM customers WHERE state='DL' OR points>1000;
-- 1) Here, we select all the customers in state & then all cutomers with points greater than 1000 & then we do the UNION of 2 queries
-- 2) Even if you don't do the union, then the query will read all the rows of the table but the source will not be table from disk, rather it is index of column from ram memory which is fast compared to disk access
EXPLAIN SELECT customer_id FROM customers WHERE points+10 > 1000;
-- here, you need to isolate your columns from points+10>1000 to points>990....

-- SORTING INDEXES: If we apply sort to the table with index, then the index is already sorted acc. to the index columns & table primary key...
-- But if we use sort on a table or column with no index for them then, sql uses filesort algo to sort the columns which reads data from disk, uses more time to read & also need to sort the data

-- GET LAST QUERY EXECUTION TIME
SHOW STATUS LIKE 'last_query_cost';

-- SECURING DATABASES:
-- CREATING USER: it accepts username@(ip_address/host_name/domain_name)
-- So here abc user can only connect to the db if they are in the same local machine
-- IDENTIFIED BY: It is followed by the password for the user
CREATE USER abc@127.0.0.1 IDENTIFIED BY 'qwerty'

-- VIEWING USERS(for mySQL)
SELECT * FROM mysql.user

-- DROPING USER
DROP USER abc@127.0.0.1

-- CHANGE/REPLACE PASSWORD
-- for user: 'abc'
SET PASSWORD FOR abc='12345'
-- for admin or current active account:
SET PASSWORD='12345'


-- Granting PRIVILIGES
-- for 'abc' user
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, EXECUTE ON sql_store.* TO abc@127.0.0.1
-- for admin
GRANT ALL TO *.* TO 'abc'

-- View PROVIIGIES of 'abc' user
SHOW GRANTS FROM 'abc'


-- How to REVOKE any unintended permission given
REVOKE CREATE VIEW ON sql_store FOR 'abc';


-- TRUNCATE: REMOVE Every Record from a TABLE
TRUNCATE TABLE users_archive;
-- DROP: DELETE a TABLE
DROP TABLE users_archive;
SELECT * FROM users;
SELECT * FROM users_archive;
